# CustomEmojis

__Version:__ 1.18+

__By:__ MRBBATES1

__Description:__

This is my Custom Emojis Behaviour and Resource pack used to showcase my how to video on how to add custom emojis into minecraft.

If you are adding 'CustomEmojisBP' to your world you must enable the gametest toggle, otherwise this behaviour pack wont work.

Please note you use the behaviour pack at your own risk. This is useing experimental mode and should be done on a copy of your world.

Due to changes in the gametest system the behaviour pack now has a minimum version of 1.19
